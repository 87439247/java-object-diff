1. In order to use this framework, all you need to do is to add this dependency to your POM:

  ```xml
<dependency>
        <groupId>de.danielbechler</groupId>
        <artifactId>java-object-diff</artifactId>
        <version>0.91</version>
</dependency>
```

2. That's it! Now you're ready to go!

## Dependency not found?

It can take up to 2 hours after the release of a new version until it is actually mirrored to the Maven Central repository. So if it isn't available right away, please try again a few hours later. If after a couple of hours it's still not available, feel free to report the issue, so I can investigate.
